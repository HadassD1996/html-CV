<h2>Summary</h2>
As a Sales Support Engineer, a significant aspect of my role involves developing Business intelligence
solutions using POWER BI. Beyond fulfilling requests from the CEO and other managers for report
creation, I proactively develop dashboards to facilitate strategic decision-making and identify
opportunities for process optimization. Leveraging my expertise in tools such as Power BI, Tableau,
and Qlik Sense, acquired through both academic coursework and professional experience, I am poised
to make substantial contributions to my workplace.
